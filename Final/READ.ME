Any issues you encountered:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One difficulty I had was with the contact form page. I couldn’t figure out how to actually send the form to my email, so for time purposes, I decided to create the illusion that the message was sent. 
I used JavaScript to stop the page from reloading when the user clicks 'Send'. 
Then I reset the form fields and temporarily change the button text to say 'Sent ✓' for a few seconds before it goes back to normal.

Another problem i had was getting the survey popup to show only the first time someone visited the page. At first, it kept showing up every time. 
I figured out how to use something called localStorage in JavaScript to remember if the user had already seen it.

                        <p>In May 2024, I visited Dallas, Texas to celebrate my cousin’s college graduation. The trip was short but memorable, filled with family, good food, and new experiences. The first thing I noticed when stepping outside the airport was the heat—it was intense and dry, like walking into an oven. Despite the weather, there was a buzz in the air. Downtown Dallas was alive with music, conversation, and celebration, as proud graduates and their families filled the city. It felt good to be part of that energy, knowing how hard my cousin had worked to get there.</p>
                        <p>One of the most surprising things was how common cowboy hats were. I’d always thought of them as more of a stereotype, but in Dallas, people wore them like any other accessory. They weren’t just tourists, either—locals sported them with pride, whether at restaurants, in stores, or just walking down the street. It gave the city a distinct personality that I wasn’t expecting. That authenticity carried over into the food as well. We ate everything from barbecue brisket to spicy tacos, and every meal felt like a celebration of southern flavor. I still think about the smoky ribs and buttery cornbread we had at a roadside spot recommended by a local.</p>
                        <p>More than anything, this trip was about family. We spent most of our time reminiscing, laughing, and supporting my cousin during one of the biggest moments of her life. It reminded me how important it is to be present for each other, even when life gets busy. Dallas gave us the perfect backdrop for that reconnection—full of warmth, pride, and culture. As the weekend ended and we said our goodbyes, I felt grateful not only for the celebration but also for the chance to experience a new place that now holds special memories.</p>

              In May of 2019, I took a trip to Nantucket with my aunt, an experience that felt both exciting and strangely nostalgic. We traveled by boat—my first time on one—and while I tried to take in the beauty of the open water, my mind kept drifting to <em>Titanic</em>, imagining every possible disaster scenario.

              But as we approached the island, any lingering nerves faded. Nantucket looked like something straight out of a Hallmark movie, with its charming cottages, cobblestone streets, and a quiet, timeless atmosphere that felt almost familiar despite it being my first visit.

              There was something about the salty breeze and the way the town seemed untouched by time that made it feel like stepping into a memory I hadn't actually lived.

            Nantucket wasn’t just a picturesque island—it was a place that felt frozen in time. The slow pace of life, the smell of the salty air, and the warmth of the locals made it unlike anywhere else I had been.

            Walking through the town, I was drawn to the old whaling cottages, each with its own charm, covered in weathered gray shingles and framed by blooming hydrangeas. The cobblestone streets, though tricky to walk on, added to the island’s historic feel, making every moment feel like a scene from a classic novel.

            One of the highlights of my trip was visiting Brant Point Lighthouse, standing tall against the endless blue sky. As I watched the waves crash against the shore, I felt a deep sense of peace—something I hadn’t realized I needed. The simple beauty of Nantucket, from its untouched beaches to the local bakeries filled with the smell of fresh pastries, made it a place I knew I would always long to return to.

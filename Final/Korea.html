                        <p>In August 2024, I spent a week studying abroad in South Korea. Though short, the experience was incredibly rich and transformative. From the moment I landed in Seoul, I was struck by the energy of the city—alive with a seamless blend of tradition and cutting-edge innovation. Our program focused on Korean culture, history, and technology, and I found myself learning as much outside the classroom as I did within it. Each day brought something new: visiting palaces, exploring local markets, and engaging in discussions with Korean students and professors.</p>
                        <p>One of the most memorable parts of the trip was our cultural immersion activities. We had the chance to try hanbok, make traditional rice cakes, and attend a K-pop dance workshop. These moments helped me understand Korean values in a way that no textbook could—through experience, laughter, and shared curiosity. The food was also a highlight. From tteokbokki at street stalls to traditional bibimbap served in stone bowls, every meal was a reminder of how deeply food reflects identity and history.</p>
                        <p>Even in just seven days, Korea left a deep impression on me. The program strengthened my interest in global education and opened my eyes to the nuances of cultural exchange. As I left Seoul, I felt more connected to the world and more inspired to keep exploring it. This trip wasn’t just a week abroad—it was a spark for future learning, friendships, and global thinking.</p>

                        <p> In the summer of 2022, I traveled to Jamaica to visit my family, something I do often but never take for granted. Unlike a typical vacation, this trip wasn’t about exploring a new place—it was about returning to a home that has always been a part of me. We stayed at our house in Kingston, where everything felt familiar and comforting. The moment I arrived, I could breathe easier—the air was fresher, the pace of life was slower, and there was an undeniable warmth that I don’t always feel in America. </p> 
                        <p> Even though I’ve been to Jamaica many times, each visit reminds me of the things I miss the most. The streets were alive with music and conversation, the kind of background noise that feels like home rather than chaos. I spent my days catching up with family, enjoying the simplicity of life without the constant rush I’ve grown used to. There’s something about being in Jamaica that makes everything feel less complicated—less about deadlines and expectations and more about being present. </p>
                        <p> One of the highlights, as always, was the food. Nothing compares to the flavors of a home-cooked Jamaican meal. From ackee and saltfish in the mornings to jerk chicken and rice and peas later in the day, every bite reminded me of what I’d been missing. Even something as simple as fresh fruit tasted better, like it actually belonged to the land. Jamaica isn’t just a place I visit; it’s a place that keeps me grounded. No matter how far I go or how much changes in my life, coming back always reminds me of who I am and where I come from. </p>

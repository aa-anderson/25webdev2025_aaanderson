            >Checkpoint is a travel blog created as part of my midterm project
            for my web development class. This blog serves as a platform to
            share my travel experiences, tips, and recommendations, all while
            showcasing the skills I've developed throughout the course. Here,
            you'll find posts about destinations, adventures, and the stories
            that make travel so special. Join me on my journey and explore new
            places through the eyes of a passionate traveler and budding web
            developer!</i
